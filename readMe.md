# Stock Movement Explainer (AI-Powered)

This project uses financial data and natural language processing to explain *why* a stock moved on a given day. It fetches stock price data and analyzes financial news to generate AI summaries.

## Progress Log
- âœ… Day 1: Set up repo and fetched historical price data using yfinance.


## Limitations:
Due to limitations in the yfinance library, this project is unable to draw stock data from specific dates. Rather, it draws the most significant news stories within the specified timeframe that can summarize why the stock has performed the way it has.
